There will be eight small homework assignments with theory exercises (H1-H8), and seven implementation projects. The final grade will be a weighted sum of the individual grades:

H1 - H8: 10% together
Bandit Agent: 10%
Monte-Carlo Tree Search: 10%
Neural Network Part 1: 10%
Neural Network Part 2: 15%
L-systems: 10%
Terrain Generation Part 1: 15%
Terrain Generation Part 2: 20%


Retakes

Every student is allowed to resubmit two implementation projects. Those will replace your previous submission, if you improve in score.

Please send your submissions by email to both T.Miltzow@uu.nl and J.L.Vermeulen@uu.nl. The deadline is 16 July at 18:00.
