'''Finally, a small hint: your agent will need to do a lot of simulations
based on a random agent. It just so happens that a random agent is already
implemented, as it is the opponent you will be playing against.
An easy way to simulate a game is to create a copy of the board (look up 
how to create a deep copy in Python, to avoid modifying the original
 unintentionally) and then use the Game.from_board method to create 
 a new game from the given board state, using two new random agents. 
 Then you can just play the game by calling Game.play(), 
 which returns the agent that won the game, or None if it was a tie.'''
