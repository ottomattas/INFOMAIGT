# Implementation Projects

There will be seven implementation projects for this course. You will work on the first four individually, and on the last three in pairs. Click on one of the links below to view the details. Most projects will use Python. Installation is very simple, but it is important to follow the instructions below to have a proper setup.

## Windows
1. Go to python.org and download the latest release (currently 3.9.4).
2. Run the installer as administrator.
3. Tick the box "Add Python 3.9 to PATH" and select "Customize installation".
4. Under "Optional Features", make sure the "pip" checkbox is ticked, then click "Next".
5. Under "Advanced Options", make sure "Add Python to environment variables" is ticked, then click "Install".

## Linux
1. Python comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions. However, make sure you have Python 3 installed. The code we provide will not work with Python 2.
2. Install pip from your package manager. Depending on your distro, the version for Python 3 may be called pip3.

## Mac OS X
Unfortunately, we can't test how to install Python on Mac. However, python.org offers an installer for OS X, so perhaps the instructions for Windows somewhat apply.
