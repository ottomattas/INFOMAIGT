Simulation
-----------------------------
Assignment 1
Give three examples of content that could be suitably generated by simulation.
* A field of obstacles simulated for testing autonomous vehicles in virtual traffic.
* Buildings for urban areas or a full skyline of a city.
* Weather. Cloud and dynamic weather system.
* Plants, obviously.

Assignment 2
The method we discussed builds the terrain starting from a river network. This may give problems with the detail of the terrain in areas far away from any rivers. Why is this the case?
* Terrain features are dependent on the river network and the drain basins which need to form as a result. If there is no river, there is no need for a basin which means there is no need for variety in landscape and terrain elevation. This could lead to terrain which seems barren, even flat and with not much variety.

Assignment 3
For this method, we fix the vertices of our graph at the start. What advantage does this give us compared to the previous method?
* This gives a lot more flexibility in terms of covering the whole terrain with interesting and life-like features as we essentially sample the whole island/terrain segment. These dependant vertices can represent not only the terrain but also direction of water flow or how the river would actually behave. Additionally, noise will be generated only after all the other layers are defined, so that we will gain more granularity over the small details as well.

Assignment 4
This method simulates the interaction between an ecosystem of plants and the terrain.
Name three other things a terrain might interact with that could also be modelled in the same framework.
* Animal population (humans, cows, fish);
* Construction (buildings, cities);
* Meteor showers (that leave craters).

Genetic Programming
-----------------------------
Assignment 1
Name two benefits of working with a terrain generation function instead of a mesh.
* Computationally more performant as there is no need to keep calculations in the memory but do them on the fly;
* The function will allow for content generation at any given time-step continuously, giving an arbitrary level of detail which is not present in meshes.

Assignment 2
Why do we include the existence of a path to the exit in the fitness function, instead of throwing out all individuals where such a path does not exist?
* To keep the infeasible (without a path to the exit) individuals allows us to inform our evolution process, first and foremost. Existence of a path to the exit in the fitness function will allow us to assume to a degree that such a path exists.
Now, couple these two points together. We will get a solution that evolves through learning from infeasible individuals while converging towards a desirable outcome.

Assignment 3
Name two things we should include in the Layout fitness function of ANGELINA1.
* There needs to be a playable character;
* Position of the entities needs to not overlay each other;
* The number of entities in a certain space.

Assignment 4
Name two things we should include in the Level fitness function of ANGELINA2.
* A ratio between empty space and platforms;
* Making sure that each type of template is used in a desirable distribution within the level;
* As a bonus, we could define the grouping of templates usedÂ versus individual templates used and set the ratios in which these can coexist. (e.g A certain template works well with repetition while other template might only work well individually.)
